# Day 3 - Classes
## OOP - Object Oriented Programming
### There are 4 pillars
1. Inheritance (most used) - **Eliminates redundant code**.
We can use all functions and variable from parent class
2. Encapsulation - **Reduce complexity and increase reusability**.
Also used to reduce access, making private methods/
variables etc.
3. Abstraction - **Reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes**.

4. Polymorphism (Many Forms) - **Refactor code or case statements**.
It allows us to change behaviour or attributes
/ variables 

**What are classes?:**
- Class is the main factor that is 
used to implement any of these 
pillars

### Creating a class
```python
class Class_name:
    variable = "Something"

    def function(self):
        return "Something"
```

### Dog Class Example
As an introduction to coding classes, we 
created a simple Dog class:

[Dog](https://github.com/MattSokol79/Python_Classes/blob/main/dog_class.py)

### Task - Cat Class
Practiced the concepts by
creating a basic Cat class.
